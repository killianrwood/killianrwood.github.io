Hi! I'm Killian Wood, a 5th year PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder, and a member of the [Dall'Anese group](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/dallanese/group) in the department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering. 

My research primarily focuses on stochastic optimization with decision-dependent data. I also have experience with derivative-free optimization, for which I worked on projects in Scalable Guassian-process regression at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, as well as developing novel adaptive step-size schedules for stochastic subspace descent with [Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/). My research interests also include numerical linear algebra and tensor decomposition.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
